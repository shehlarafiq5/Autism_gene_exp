# Autism Gene Classification with XAI

This project uses gene expression data and applies machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) along with Explainable AI techniques (LIME, SHAP) to prioritize ASD risk genes.

## Features
- Gene expression analysis
- Classification using ML models
- Model explainability with LIME & SHAP
- Performance evaluation with metrics like AUC, MCC, F1-score, etc.
## Usage
To run the model and reproduce the results:

Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```bash 
jupyter notebook Autism_with_XAI.ipynb
```

## Requirements
Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
